<h1 align="center"> MiniMIPS </h1>

* This project was the final project of Computer Organization class.
* Before using the project, please read [project report](https://github.com/tgknyhn/MiniMIPS/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf) to see testbench results and how this processor actually works 
* Different from the view I put below, my processor takes 16-bit instructions. 
* Every module has their own testbench and results so it is easier to see problems.
